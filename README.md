# Machine Learning Tutorials
#### A collection of Machine Learning tutorials

* Basics:
  * [MNIST with Keras](notebooks/deepLearning/mnist_mlp.ipynb)
* Sentiment Analysis - todo upgrade TF and Keras versions
  * [IMDB with Keras](notebooks/deepLearning/Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Keras%20and%20CNN.ipynb)  

#### Getting started
* build_docker_image.sh - this builds the docker image with the lates TensorFlow version, python 3 and jupyter notebooks
* start_docker.sh - open the browser using the link specified when the container starts
* click on notebooks and navigate to MNIST tutorial
